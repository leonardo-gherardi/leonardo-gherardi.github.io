1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Criterion 2.4.7 Focus Visible.

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,000
Let's start by saying what its purpose is

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,660
its purpose is to make active elements more visible to users

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,220
then form and link fields.

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,700
Criterion 2.4.7 can be applied with various techniques

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:22,300
these in particular are the C15, the G195 and the G165.

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,300
The C15 technique is intended to highlight

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,300
form and link fields to facilitate insertion

9
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,900
data or highlight selected hyperlinks.

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,300
To be visualized better they must be highlighted with a bright color.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,700
G195 technique also this technique has the purpose of facilitating data entry by the user.

12
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,700
And highlight a link on a dark background

13
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:52,430
this is done by highlighting the fields that are activated based on the user's selection.

14
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:55,860
The link must be highlighted with a bright color and a yellow bar.

15
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,000
G165 technique also this technique has the purpose of facilitating data entry

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,500
but specifically, where it is usually more difficult to distinguish the elements

17
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,930
then on a dark page

18
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,430
In fact the field will turn an intense yellow

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,430
at the edges

20
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:17,360
this must also work with the index tab.

21
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,360
C15 technique applied.

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,760
So when we click on the input field so that it is more visible

23
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,000
esso assumerà un colore di sfondo molto acceso

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
In this case green.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,530
To make the choice more visible

26
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,530
The option will be highlighted.

27
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:41,100
The link itself when we go over the link

28
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,360
it will be highlighted with a lightblue color.

29
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,960
Now we will see the G195 technique applied.

30
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:55,130
When we click with the mouse to enter the data

31
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,200
the input will be underlined with a red color.

32
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:05,300
In the case of a dark page the link must become

33
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,200
yellow with a yellow border.

34
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,100
Adesso vedremo la tecnica G165 applicata.

35
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,930
So in a dark page

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,300
the input element when clicked must take a yellow outline

37
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,300
or in any case very bright

38
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,360
and the same thing must work with the index tab.

39
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,160
Now we will see programmatically how to apply the C15 technique.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,160
Let's start with the checkbox.

41
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,160
If the input type is the same as the checkbox and is focus

42
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:45,160
and the input is the same as the button and is focus

43
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:50,500
then the option will be highlighted in a very bright color.

44
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:57,300
Now we see the highlighted input so if the input dot class is focus

45
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,200
then it is clicked assumes a different background color.

46
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,130
Now let's see the C15 technique for the highlighted link.

47
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,130
If element a is hover

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,900
then the user passes over it with the mouse.

49
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,630
Or if it is active, if it is focus it takes on a different background color.

50
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:18,360
How to apply the G195 technique programmatically.

51
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,000
Form elemnt.

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,930
As the criterion wants, it is placed inside a table

53
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,330
if the input point class is focus.

54
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:30,400
Then it assumes a bottom edge then below

55
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,960
of 5 red pixels.

56
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:37,360
For the link on a dark background if a dot class is hover

57
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,560
then it takes on a yellow color and double underline.

58
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,930
How to apply the G165 technique.

59
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,200
If the input dot class is focus then it assumes

60
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,730
a 4 pixel yellow border.
